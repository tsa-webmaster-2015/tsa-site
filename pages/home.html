            <span>ABOUT US</span>
            <br>At our school, we take technology very seriously. Our TSA chapter has more than a hundred members, far more than nearly any other school in Colorado. Last year at the state competition, our competitors garnished awards in thirteen events, from Software Development to Underwater ROV, and we are perennial competitors at the national TSA competitions. We are a very technically-oriented school overall, with twenty-seven business and tech classes offered throughout high school to give a truly immersive high school experience in technology and engineering. TSA is one of the biggest extracurricular organizations at our school, a tribute to how popular technology has become here, and we hope to see even more members as the year progresses.

            But our school isn't just home to one of the state's biggest and brightest TSA chapters. It also has a wide variety of STEM classes. Our school is very technology- and science-oriented, and STEM activities are not only popular, but encouraged. It is not uncommon to see a knot of kids coding Java out in the hallway before class in the morning, and the technology room is almost always full of people working on their own tech projects. The technology and graphic classes are the most popular electives for all grades, so much so that they're almost prohibitively hard to get into, and nearly every period is full.
